## Liquidation (My Understanding)

Liquidation protects the protocol and lenders.

When a borrower takes too much loan compared to collateral,
the position becomes risky.

If risk crosses a limit (example: 75%),
liquidation happens automatically.

### Key Points
- Borrower loses collateral
- Lenders are protected
- Bots trigger liquidation
- This keeps protocol safe
