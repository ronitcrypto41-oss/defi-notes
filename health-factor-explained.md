## Health Factor (My Understanding)

Health Factor shows how safe a borrower position is.

It compares collateral value with borrowed amount.

### Simple Meaning
- Health Factor > 1 → Position is safe
- Health Factor = 1 → Position is risky
- Health Factor < 1 → Liquidation happens

### Why It Exists
- Protect lenders
- Protect the protocol
- Control liquidation risk
